# Blistful

This to-do list app allows users to stay organised by listing their tasks in a user friendly manner. Features include setting reminders (repeating or not), adding subtasks and adding notes.

This is a majorly refactored version of ListApp2. Updates include a more robust backend by using recycler view and room. Swipe to delete and undo snackbar have been added for enhanced UX.

This is a sister app of Task Killer https://github.com/charliemcg/TaskKillerV2
Though Blistful lacks the customisation of Task Killer it has a less aggressive UI and features tablet support.
